This code repository primarily stores publicly available content related to YOLO-SK, including training data, model structure, and model code.

- The `code` folder contains all the code for the YOLO-SK model.
- The `data` folder stores the training data for the YOLO-SK model, including the image file `images.tar` and the annotation file folder `labels` used for training. The dataset images are sourced from the PASCAL VOC 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets, while the annotation files are converted into YOLO format. If  `images.tar` is too large to download,please visit the follow urls:
